CP,Prices: Consumer Price Indices,"Household sector, and goods and services acquired by households","The FAOSTAT monthly Food CPI and General CPI database was based on the ILO CPI data until December 2014. In 2014, IMF-ILO-FAO agreed to transfer global CPI data compilation from ILO to IMF. Upon agreement, CPIs for all items and its sub components originates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UN Statistics Division(UNSD) for countries not covered by the IMF. However, due to a limited time coverage from IMF and UNSD for a number of countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Central Bank of Western African States (BCEAO), Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), UNdata, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and national statistical office website data are used for missing historical data from IMF and UNSD food CPI. The FAO CPI dataset for all items(or general CPI) and the Food CPI, consists of a complete and consistent set of time series from January 2000 onwards. Data gaps on monthly Food CPI and General CPI are filled using statistical estimation procedures to have full data coverage for all countries for Food CPI and for General CPI. These indices measure the price change between the current and reference periods of the average basket of goods and services purchased by households. The CPI,all items is typically used to measure and monitor inflation, set monetary policy targets, index social benefits such as pensions and unemployment benefits, and to escalate thresholds and credits in the income tax systems and wages in public and private wage contracts. The FAOSTAT monthly Food CPI inflation rates are annual year-over-year inflation or percentage change over corresponding month of the previous year.

CS,Macro-Economic Indicators: Capital Stock,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing (ISIC A+B Rev.3 and A Rev.4)","As part of the FAO Agriculture Capital Stock (ACS) database, ESS-FAO publishes country-by-country data on physical investment in agriculture, forestry and fishing as measured by the System of National Accounts (SNA) concept of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index. The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). The database is further supplemented by OECD Structural Analysis database (OECD STAN) and in a few countries data from the countrys statistics website. If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions. With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period). In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models) for the data series from 1995 to 2018.The values of Agriculture Capital Stock related indicators for 2020, including Agriculture Investment Ratio, Agriculture Orientation Index, Net Capital Stock, Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Consumption of Fixed Capital, are estimated using the Holt-Winters (HW) method (Cipra et al., 1995). The HW method is an exponential smoothing method for forecasting the annual values of economic variables. In this context, the HW method relies on existing (historical) values of the Agriculture Capital Stock. The predicted value is an extrapolation of the historical values to the specified target date, which extends the timeline without considering seasonality in the annual series.All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2015. Calculation of constant price series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used.",Ms. Boero Veronica / Mr. Vollaro Michele,macrostats@fao.org,2021-09-24T00:00:00,zip,csv,1193KB,130578,https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_CapitalStock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip
EA,Investment: Development Flows to Agriculture,"All sectors with an emphasis on the Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector","The Development Flows to Agriculture (DFA) dataset is an important component of Agricultural Investment Financing Statistics, together with Government Expenditures on Agriculture (GEA), Foreign Direct Investment in Agriculture (FDI), Credit to Agriculture (C2A) and Foreign Remittances (FR).  The DFA dataset relies on the OECDs Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which provides comprehensive data on development flows from all donors to all recipients since the early 1970s. The use of CRS for compiling the DFA dataset capitalizes on the expertise of the OECD in this area, while minimizing respondents burden and avoiding duplication of work. The DFA dataset includes Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows, Other Official Flows (OOFs) and Private Grants reported by donor countries, international organizations and private entities to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Directorate. The objective of the DFA database is to provide readily available data to enable analysis on aid flows and the purposes they serve, with an emphasis on agriculture, its components, and environmental protection.The data series Other Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (total) provides additional information on aid that accrues in fact to agriculture, but is included in aid flows assigned to other sectors. Accrual to agriculture is dedicated from the text and the description of projects.    Among the indicators published in the DFA dataset is the Share of Total DFA. This is indicator is computed as a share of total aid flows devoted to Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing in Total aid flows, including Official Development Assistance (ODA), Other Official Flows (OOF) and Private Grant for all purposes from all donors. This indicator is conceptually similar to SDG indicator 2.a.2 ""Total official flows to the agriculture sector"", which is under the custodianship of the OECD with FAO as a partner Agency. It is important to underline that SDG 2.a.2 follows a methodology that is different from that of the Share of Total DFA published in FAOSTAT, and is described by OECD in the Handbook available at https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/SDGeHandbook/Indicator+2.a.2 .The computation of SDG indicator 2.a.2 uses ODA and OOF sector-allocable aid flows as a denominator.","Piero Conforti, Eun Jeong LEE",faostat@fao.org / Investment-data@fao.org,2021-06-18T00:00:00,zip,csv,88192KB,9504103,https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Development_Assistance_to_Agriculture_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip

Data are computed geospatially using Tier 1 default factors of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventories and of the Supplement on Wetlands (IPCC, 2006; 2014) for the organic soils component. Estimates are available by country and with global coverage, in complete time series for the period 19902019. The database is updated annually.  The FAOSTAT domain Fires disseminates information by country on: activity data (in hectares of burned area and tonnes of burned biomass); and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in kilotonnes of N2O, CH4 and CO2). Data are available for all countries and territories, for standard FAOSTAT regional aggregations, and for Annex I and non-Annex I country groups.  The uncertainties in FAOSTAT estimates of emissions from fires in organic soils area very high (IPCC, 2014). FAOSTAT estimates rely on remotely sensed data of burning biomass in areas where organic soils are also mapped. On the one hand, the presence of fires may not always be a signal that the underlying peat layer is burning.  On the other hand, remote sensing information has limited capacity to detect the smoldering fires that are typical of peatlands.  Furthermore, the methods applied herein do not distinguish between fires on drained and undrained organic soils, rather assuming burning of the organic layer in both cases. Existing literature and country reports support FAOSTAT country estimates in South East Asia (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam), where burning of the organic layer is associated with deforestation fires and drainage. In all other countries, absence of literature and lack of other evidence suggest that FAOSTAT emissions data from fires in organic soils should be used with caution, as a tool to investigate possible national hotspots, rather than for evaluating national GHG inventory data. There is insufficient information to date to confirm the actual presence, quantity and causes (i.e. human-induced vs wildfires) of fires in organic soils outside Southeastern Asia.  This FAOSTAT domain also disseminates the activity data and emissions data reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on fire disturbance for a range of vegetation types in Forest Land and Grassland and from fires in organic soils.

The dataset reports expenditure for Central Government (or Budgetary Central Government, when Central Government is not available) and General Government. Since 2018, to align with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014, countries report Central Government excluding Social Security Funds. Even though, for some countries the time series still refer to Central Government including Social Security Funds. For further details, please refer to the file Country Notes available at http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/documents/IG/IG_Country_Notes_e.pdf","The Statistics Division of FAO collects annually data on Government Expenditure on Agriculture through a questionnaire, which was developed in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF is the responsible institution for the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology and annually collects GFS data, including Expenditure by Functions of Government (COFOG). The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is an international classification developed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), with the aim of categorise governments' functions according to their purposes. The FAO questionnaire aligns with Table 7 of the IMF GFS questionnaire, replicates the relevant aggregates and drills down to request additional detail related to Agriculture. The FAO dataset consists of a time series, from 2001 onwards, of Total Government Expenditure and expenditure in: Economic affairs; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, along with its three disaggregated subsectors of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; and Environmental Protection. In addition, expenditure in each detailed function are further disaggregated into Recurrent and Capital expenditure. Additional indicators include the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure, and the Agriculture Orientation Index (ratio between the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture Value Added as Share of GDP). Imputation methods were used to provide a complete and consistent global dataset as some challenges arise with different stages of implementation of the GFS methodology and COFOG classification, and differences in the data collection and reporting at country level. Data are reported for the highest level of government available (Consolidated general government, consolidated central government or budgetary central government) and are available for about 100 countries on a regular basis.

The database also proposes additional indicators such as per capita GDP, year-on-year growth rates and measures of industry contribution to GDP.All data relating to GDP, GFCF, AFF, and to MAN originates from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates database, which consists of a complete and consistent set of time series of the main National Accounts (NA) aggregates of all UN Members States and other territories in the world for which National Accounts information is available. The UNSD database's content is based on the countries' official NA data reported to UNSD through the annual National Accounts Questionnaire, supplemented with data estimates for any years and countries with incomplete or inconsistent information (See http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Introduction.asp).Series relating to the sub-industry Ag are obtained from the UNSD NA Official Country Data databases while series on the FB, Tob and FBT industry originates from  UNIDO INDSTAT2 databases. In order to ensure that sub-industry series are consistent in levels with National Accounts based series, which is needed to support comparability across industries (agriculture vs. agro-industry and sub-industries), we proceed to a rescaling exercise of UNIDO originating series on UNSD National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates data series (See Section 20 for a more detailed description of the data processing steps).",Veronica Boero,macrostats@fao.org,2022-03-01T00:00:00,zip,csv,6320KB,660827,https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Macro-Statistics_Key_Indicators_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip

It is obtained by dividing a current price value of a given aggregate by its real counterpart.  When calculated from the major national accounting aggregates such as GDP or agriculture value added, implicit price deflators pertains to wider ranges of goods and services in the economy than that represented by any of the individual price indexes (such as CPIs, PPIs). Movements in an implicit price deflator reflect both changes in price and changes in the composition of the aggregate for which the deflator is calculated.In the FAOSTAT Deflators database, all series are derived from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Analysis of Main Aggregates database (UNSD AMA).

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it.
